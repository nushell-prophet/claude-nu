# Initial request (only the user can edit this section)

I need a command to parse claude code sessions for structured information:

1. Count of user messages
2. `str length` of user messages
1. Timestamps (first and last)
3. `str length` of `claude code` responses
1. Count of agents usages
1. List of mentioned files
1. List of read files
1. List of edited files

The command need a flag to specify the list of paths or a single path or a directory to parse in.
