# Initial request (only the user can edit this section)

I need a command to parse Claude Code sessions for structured information:

1. Count of user messages
2. `str length` of user messages
3. Timestamps (first and last)
4. `str length` of Claude Code responses
5. Count of agent usages
6. List of mentioned files
7. List of read files
8. List of edited files

The command needs a flag to specify the list of paths, a single path, or a directory to parse.
